Comments: The plot shows that the probability that at least two people
share a birthday increases quickly as the number of people in the room
grows. When only a few people are present the chance of a shared
birthday is very small but the probability rises sharply as the group
becomes larger. Around twenty three people the probability reaches about
fifty percent and by forty people it is close to one hundred percent.
This finding illustrates the birthday paradox where even small groups
have a surprisingly high chance of sharing a birthday because the number
of possible pairs increases rapidly with group size.
